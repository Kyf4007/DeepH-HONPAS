# DeepH-HONPAS
Equivariant neural network deep learning Hamiltonian code supported by HONPAS

# Introduction
DeepH-HONPAS is a computational package designed for electronic structure calculations. It integrates DeepH (https://github.com/mzjb/DeepH-pack?tab=readme-ov-file) with Hefei Order-N Packages for Ab initio Simulations (HONPAS, https://github.com/xmqin/HONPAS?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file) to provide efficient and accurate DFT results. This code support DeepH and DeepH-E3.

# Installation

For environment setup, please refer to https://github.com/mzjb/DeepH-pack?tab=readme-ov-file.
When the environment activated, install with:

HONPAS is required for dataset generation. Please refer to https://github.com/xmqin/HONPAS?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file for HONPAS installation and usage.
If you only want to try the machine learning code, the dataset for TBG and TBmos2 are also available.

# Usage

For DeepH-E3, the main difference is the neural network structure used in the training step.
